# Summarization: 

**It is always better to integrate programming languages that are suitable for each other on the page to give the page the required strength and other characteristics related to the design, shape and method of hosting data.

**This is the case in html, where it forms the basis of the page, while JavaScript improves performance, hosting graphics, and the interplay between the programmer and the browser, while css s adds style and general appearance and improves HTML programming structure.

**We learned in the past that the old browser (often any kind) may not read html5 pages, but it may read html format. In general, regardless of the type of browser, new or old, it reads the page data through its understanding of the language or programming codes.
In addition to that, the documents represent the entire page and can be read directly when the browser receives the command. JavaScript also works with it in html files.
